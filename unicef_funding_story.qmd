# Introduction

In today's data-centric world, the ability to derive actionable insights and convey them effectively has become crucial. Data storytelling bridges complex datasets and strategic decision-making by using powerful visual narratives. This project reconstructs a Tableau-based corporate analysis using Python, focusing on UNICEF, through data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques. Python packages such as Polars and Plotnine, with Quarto for report generation and GitHub Pages for deployment, empower this end-to-end workflow.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset focuses on UNICEF's funding and programmatic metrics over the past two decades.

| Key Variables           | Description                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Revenue (USD Billions)    | Total annual donations and grants |
| Net Program Impact (USD Billions) | Value of program delivery |
| R&D Expenses (USD Billions) | Investment in research and initiatives |
| Market Cap (USD Trillions)  | Mocked field for illustrative purposes |

# Tools and Technologies

- Google Colab: Python coding environment
- Polars: High-speed data manipulation
- Plotnine: Grammar of graphics visualization
- Quarto: HTML document generation
- GitHub Pages: Online project publication

# Data Wrangling and EDA

```{python}
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_csv("unicef_funding.csv")
unicef_data = df.filter(pl.col("organization") == "UNICEF")

summary = unicef_data.groupby("year").agg([
    pl.col("revenue").mean().alias("avg_revenue"),
    pl.col("program_impact").mean().alias("avg_program_impact"),
    pl.col("r_and_d_expenses").mean().alias("avg_rnd"),
    pl.col("market_cap").mean().alias("avg_market_cap")
])
summary.head()
```

# Visualisations

## 1. Revenue and Program Impact Over Time

```{python}
from plotnine import *

(ggplot(unicef_data, aes(x='year')) +
 geom_line(aes(y='revenue'), color='blue') +
 geom_line(aes(y='program_impact'), color='green') +
 labs(title='UNICEF Revenue and Program Impact Over Time'))
```

## 2. R&D Expenses Over Time

```{python}
(ggplot(unicef_data, aes(x='year', y='r_and_d_expenses')) +
 geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='purple') +
 labs(title='UNICEF R&D Investment Over Years', x='Year', y='R&D Expenses'))
```

## 3. Market Cap vs Revenue (Illustrative)

```{python}
(ggplot(unicef_data, aes(x='revenue', y='market_cap')) +
 geom_point(alpha=0.6) +
 geom_smooth(method='lm') +
 labs(title='Market Cap vs Revenue (Illustrative)'))
```

## 4. Funding Breakdown by Program Area

```{python}
# Assume segment_df exists
(ggplot(segment_df, aes(x='year', y='segment_revenue', fill='segment')) +
 geom_area() +
 labs(title='UNICEF Funding by Program Area'))
```
