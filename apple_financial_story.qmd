# Introduction

In today's data-centric world, deriving actionable insights and conveying them effectively has become crucial. Data storytelling bridges complex datasets and strategic decision-making. This project reconstructs a Tableau-based corporate analysis using Python, focusing on Apple Inc., through data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset focuses on Apple Inc.'s financial and operational metrics over two decades.

| Key Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Revenue (USD Billions) | Total annual revenue |
| Net Income (USD Billions) | Profit after all expenses |
| R&D Expenses (USD Billions) | Investment in research and development |
| Market Cap (USD Trillions) | Total market capitalization |

# Tools and Technologies

- Google Colab: Python coding environment
- Polars: High-speed data manipulation
- Plotnine: Grammar of graphics visualization
- Quarto: HTML document generation
- GitHub Pages: Project publication

# Data Wrangling and EDA

```{python}
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_csv("apple_financials.csv")
apple_data = df.filter(pl.col("company") == "Apple")

summary = apple_data.groupby("year").agg([
    pl.col("revenue").mean().alias("avg_revenue"),
    pl.col("net_income").mean().alias("avg_net_income"),
    pl.col("r_and_d_expenses").mean().alias("avg_rnd"),
    pl.col("market_cap").mean().alias("avg_market_cap")
])
summary.head()
```

# Visualisations

## Revenue and Net Income Over Time

```{python}
from plotnine import *

(ggplot(apple_data, aes(x='year')) +
 geom_line(aes(y='revenue'), color='blue') +
 geom_line(aes(y='net_income'), color='green') +
 labs(title='Apple Revenue and Net Income Over Time'))
```

## R&D Expenses Over Time

```{python}
(ggplot(apple_data, aes(x='year', y='r_and_d_expenses')) +
 geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='purple') +
 labs(title='Apple R&D Investment Over Years', x='Year', y='R&D Expenses'))
```

## Market Cap vs Revenue

```{python}
(ggplot(apple_data, aes(x='revenue', y='market_cap')) +
 geom_point(alpha=0.6) +
 geom_smooth(method='lm') +
 labs(title='Market Cap vs Revenue'))
```

## Revenue by Business Segment (Mocked)

```{python}
# Assume segment_df exists
(ggplot(segment_df, aes(x='year', y='segment_revenue', fill='segment')) +
 geom_area() +
 labs(title='Apple Revenue by Business Segment'))
```
